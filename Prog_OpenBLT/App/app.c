/** \brief     The firmware info table.
 *  \details   Note that this constant table is linked to the section
 *             ".infoTable". This section is defined in the linker script and configured
 *             such that this info table appears at the same location as configured with
 *             the BOOT_INFO_TABLE_ADDR configuration macro and has the same length as
 *             configured with the BOOT_INFO_TABLE_LEN configuration macro.
 *
 *             Instead of adding this table directly in the code of the firmware, an
 *             alternative approach would be to patch it into the firmware file during a
 *             postbuild operation. A free application such as "srec_cat" can be
 *             used. It's also possible to build your own patch tool based on LibOpenBLT,
 *             since this library includes firmware file reading and editing
 *             functionality.
 *  \attention When using the bootloader's default internal signature checksum
 *             verification mechanism, this info table should not be located in the area
 *             that the bootloader's flash driver calls the "boot block", unless the
 *             info table itself is located before the actual location configured for the
 *             signature checksum value. The "boot block" is defined as the first
 *             FLASH_WRITE_BLOCK_SIZE bytes of the user program's flash.
 *
 *             If the info table were to be located in the "boot block" and after the
 *             actual signature checksum location, a miniscule chance is present that a
 *             power loss during the write of this "boot block" results in a valid
 *             signature checksum value, yet only partially written (and therefore
 *             invalid) info table.
 *
 *             Note that this restriction does not apply when using the Improved Checksum
 *             add-on module, instead of the default internal signature checksum. More
 *             info regarding the Improved Checksum add-on module can be found here:
 *             - https://www.feaser.com/en/addons.php#checksum
